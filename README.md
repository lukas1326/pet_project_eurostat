The project's goal is to automate the extraction of data from the website https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat. The "eurostat_dataset" class simplifies the process of obtaining datasets by code (which can be easily done from the website), cleans, and expands encoded information. Therefore, there is no need to perform a lot of routine work, you can simply get a dataset ready for analysis.


Using the Eurostat datasets, an analysis was conducted to assess the ability of European countries to meet their electricity needs through the generation of electricity from renewable sources.
